Paul Graham (/ɡræm/; born November 13, 1964)[3] is an English-American computer scientist, writer and essayist, entrepreneur and investor. His work includes the programming language Arc, the startup Viaweb (later renamed Yahoo! Store), co-founding the startup accelerator and seed capital firm Y Combinator, a number of essays and books, and the media webpage Hacker News.

He is the author of the computer programming books On Lisp,[4] ANSI Common Lisp,[5] and Hackers & Painters.[6] Technology journalist Steven Levy has described Graham as a "hacker philosopher".[7]

Graham was born in England, where he and his family have maintained a permanent residence since 2016. He is also a citizen of the United States, where he attended all of his schooling and lived for 48 years prior to returning to England.


Education and early life
Graham and his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1968, where he attended Gateway High School. Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a nuclear physicist.[8]

Graham received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in philosophy from Cornell University in 1986.[9][10][11] He then received a Master of Science in 1988, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1990, both in computer science from Harvard University.[9][12]

Graham has also studied fine arts and painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence.[9][12]


Career
In 1996, Graham and Robert Morris founded Viaweb and recruited Trevor Blackwell shortly after. They believed that Viaweb was the first application service provider.[13] Graham received a patent for webapps based on his work at Viaweb.[14] Viaweb's software, written mostly in Common Lisp, allowed users to make their own Internet stores. In the summer of 1998, after Jerry Yang received a strong recommendation from Ali Partovi,[15] Viaweb was sold to Yahoo! for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at $49.6 million.[16] After the acquisition, the product became Yahoo! Store.

Graham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts on his personal website. Essay subjects range from "Beating the Averages",[17] which compares Lisp to other programming languages and introduced the hypothetical programming language Blub, to "Why Nerds are Unpopular",[18] a discussion of nerd life in high school. A collection of his essays has been published as Hackers & Painters[6] by O'Reilly Media, which includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and the advantages of Lisp to program it.

In 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new dialect of Lisp named Arc. It was released on 29 January 2008.[19] Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, including the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program.

In 2005, after giving a talk at the Harvard Computer Society later published as "How to Start a Startup", Graham along with Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris started Y Combinator to provide seed funding to startups, particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented founders. Y Combinator has invested in more than 1300 startups, including Reddit, Twitch (formerly Justin.tv), Xobni, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe.[20]

BusinessWeek included Paul Graham in the 2008 edition of its annual feature, The 25 Most Influential People on the Web.[21]

In response to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no representatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator's Demo Day events.[22]

In February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator.[23]

In October 2019, Graham announced a specification for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself, named Bel.[24]
